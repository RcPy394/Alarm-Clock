# Alarm-Clock
I dont own any of the music in the music file it is there to demonstrate how my code works, the code is all mine.
There must be a directory named music with .mp3 files only in it inside the project directory otherwise it will not run.
Enter the time you want the alarm to go off at in the text box and it will play the selected song from the music file.
